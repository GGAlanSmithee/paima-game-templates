# Paima Engine Templates

This repository serves as a collection of all our available templates for developers to use as a base for their game/Web3 project using Paima Engine. 

You can use these templates in one of two ways:
1. Use `./paima-engine init template` to generate the template you want locally
2. Download this repository and place the Paima standalone executable in this root folder (no need to `init template`)

You can find the documentation on how to use these templates [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com)
