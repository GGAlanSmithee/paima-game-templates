# Paima Standalone Templates

This repository serves as a collection of all our available templates. 

You can use these templates in two ways:
1. Use `paima-engine init template` to generate the template you want locally
2. Download this repository and place the Paima standalone executable in this root folder (no need to `init template`)

You can find the documentation on how to use these templates [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com)
